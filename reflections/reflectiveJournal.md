## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

Scratch is a block-based visual programming language,which use block-like interface to create project. It's very suitable for beginners and kids.

### What is visual programming?
In very general terms, visual programming describes a programming environment where visual icons and symbols are manipulated to graphically create computer code / instructions, rather than through the use of text. 

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?

### What is git?
Git is an open source version control system for developers to track the changes they make during the project.

### What is GitHub?
Github is a social platform for develomers to store their changes in the timeline.

# Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
yes, twice. I went out for a walk during the weekend.
# What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

In gist, timeboxing is a time management technique where you allocate a fixed time period to a planned activity. You work on the activity during the fixed time period and stop working on it once the time is up - then, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals.
In timeboxing time periods are called "timeboxes" and may involve larger time periods, covering periods ranging from 15 minutes to several months. A timebox always has specific deadlines and goals associated with it, and it may also involve deliverables, a budget, and milestones.

At the end of the timebox, you declare your work done, no matter what, and then you assess whether you were able to meet your goals, either completely or partially.

For example, you want to tidy up your office, but don't want to spend an entire afternoon on it. So, you allocate half an hour to this task and stop immediately once your 30-minute timebox is up no matter how much you've really managed to clean up.
I need to learn more about it. 
# On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
I give 5 for assigntment 1 Pseudocode and give 3 for my first software project.
# What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
I can code a simple project and started to learn python which I know 3 years ago. 
# Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself.
Firstly, starting learning from a small and easy tutuaril and do some practice on your own. I tried to one or two functions of pyhton every day. 
# If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
You need to start to learn python by watching the tuturial. 
# What is Python?
A coding language.
# Have you developed a habit of exploring?
Yes. Just google it not matther how much you know. 
# Have you meditated before?
yes. But i am not sure if it is meditated. 
# Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

# Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
NO 
# Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
yes. 
# How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
4 tabs. The ration of study related tabs to distraction related tabs is 4:1.
# Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
Yes,especially a new technology looks like very complicated. It feels like you push you away from something familiar. I overcome it by starting knowing more about it. 
# What is an IDE?
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). An IDE typically consists of:

Source code editor: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.
Local build automation: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
Debugger: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.
# What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
Teamwork is very important. 
# Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?

# So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
The moment when I have to decide which should be my assignment project. The analysis of my bank statement is my ideal project. however I haven't master enough skills to do that. I tried to watch tutorial online but still cant understand some code block. 
At the last few hours before deadline, I have to choose a guessing game as my project which fit for my ability. 
# What is OOP?
OOP stands for objected oriented programming. 

# Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
# Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
# What is polymorphism?
# Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
# What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
# What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
# What is pair programming?
What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
What is conscious listening?
What is a variable?
What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
What is something kind that someone has done for you?
If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
What is a fixed mindset?
What is something kind you have done for someone else?
