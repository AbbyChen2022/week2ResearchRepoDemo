text = """Disgraced chief executive Tim Boyd spent nearly two months on leave for “confidential reasons” during his short stint as the boss of a ratepayer-owned company.
More than 130 pages of emails released this week show Boyd went on leave less than four months after he started in the $430,000-a-year position at Christchurch City Holdings Ltd (CCHL).
The emails also show that ratepayers paid for Boyd to move to Christchurch.
CCHL said this was common practice and Boyd was entitled to use up to $40,000, but he did not use it all. CCHL did not say how much was used.
