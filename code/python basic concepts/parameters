###
def double(number):
    print(number*2)
double(5)
### the another way to do this is to use return
### we can give back integers, strings, booleans,floats. double (number) become integer.
def double (number):
    return number * 2
new_number=double(10)
print(new_number)
### we can pass any information via parameters but we can also pass out information with returning that information.
### creat a function that returns a string in all caps 
def uppercase(text):
     return text.upper()
print(uppercase("nick"))
### try to do a list of names
names=['nick','jane',"jack"]
for name is names:
    print(uppercase(names))
