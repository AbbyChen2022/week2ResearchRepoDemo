### def is short for define.  define a function is to give a name of chunk of code .
### anythime in Python that you see the colon(:) at the end of something, typically when we hit Enter to the next line, we are tabbed over because thats saying, we want to do something if something above has happened.
def bark():
    print("woof woof!")
### nothing show up. With function, if we want the code to run, we need to type out the function.
bark()
### the function could be multi lines
for x in range(100):
    bark()
### The above is to give a function of a chunk of code and run it over and over again.

# practice: creat a function called hello that prints " hello Abby"

def hello():
    print("Hello Abby")
hello()
for x in range(10):
   hello()
